				しかし、先の問題を解析的に解くことは不可能なことが多いため,動的計画法などを用いて数値解析的に解くことが多い.

					\item[動的計画法]
						最適化問題を部分問題に分割し,各部分問題の解を求めて合わせることにより元の問題の解を得るというアルゴリズム.
					\item[最適性原理]
						Principal of Optimality.\\
						任意の初期状態に関して決定した最適な制御則$u^{*}(x)$は,最適経路$x^{*}_t$上における残りの期間においても最適でなくてはならない.\\

				最適制御問題を離散時間(タイムステップ$\Delta t = 1$)で最小コスト関数$J^{*}$以下のように表す。
				\begin{align*}
					J^{*}_0 (x_0) = {\rm min} \sum_{t=0}^{T} {\rm cost}(x_t, u(x_t))
				\end{align*}
				\begin{description}
					\item[$J^{*}_0 (x_0)$] 状態$x_0$に関する時刻$0$から終了時刻$T$までの最小コストを出力する関数.
					\item[$J^{*}_t (x_t)$] 状態$x_t$に関する時刻$t$から終了時刻$T$までの最小コストを出力する関数.
				\end{description}
				最適性原理より
				\begin{align*}
					J^{*}_0 (x_0)
							&= {\rm min} \left\{ {\rm cost}(x_0, u(x_0)) 
									+ \sum_{t=1}^{T} {\rm cost}(x_t, u(x_t)) \right\} \\
							&= {\rm min} \left\{ {\rm cost}(x_0, u(x_0)) 
									+ {\rm min} \sum_{t=1}^{T} {\rm cost}(x_t, u(x_t)) \right\} \\
							&= {\rm min} \left\{ {\rm cost}(x_0, u(x_0)) + J^{*}_1 (x_1) \right\}
